            <h2>25. Waiver And Severability</h2>
            <p>
              No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms
              shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
              condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
              failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms
              shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
              competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
              any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
              minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will
              continue in full force and effect.
